title: "Finetuning CodeBERT for Semantic Code Search with PyTorch and Huggingface"
description: |
  Over the past few years, search engines have become more powerful thanks to the rise of deep learning methods allowing for more efficient search. Software engineering research has also greatly capitalized on this      re-emergence of deep learning to make software development more effective, for instance by making tasks such as code search more efficient than with traditional information retrieval techniques. In this post, we'll take a look on how to finetune CodeBERT,  a state-of-the-art model of code, for code search using PyTorch and HuggingFace, in less than 100 lines of code.

# What is semantic code search?

**Code search** consists of retrieving relevant code snippets from a corpus of code given a **query**. The query intends to bear the user's information need and is usually expressed as a natural language formulation. That is, the query encodes **semantic meaning** about what a user is seeking to implement, *e.g.,* how to compute matrix multiplication. This is very similar to any search engine whose main purpose is to provide useful information to the user based on an input query. 

For more details on semantic code search, I highly recommend reading the following blog post: https://github.blog/2018-09-18-towards-natural-language-semantic-code-search/
